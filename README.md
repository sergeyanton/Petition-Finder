# SENG365 Assignment 2


## Running locally

1. Use `npm install` to populate the `node_modules/` directory with up-to-date packages
2. Create a file called `.env`, following the instructions in the section below
3. Go to https://dbadmin.csse.canterbury.ac.nz and create a database with the name that you set in the `.env` file
2. Run `npm run start` or `npm run debug` to start the server
3. The server will be accessible on `localhost:4941`

### `.env` file

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of this project including the following information (note that you will need
to create the database first in phpMyAdmin):

```
SENG365_MYSQL_HOST=db2.csse.canterbury.ac.nz
SENG365_MYSQL_USER={your usercode}
SENG365_MYSQL_PASSWORD={your password}
SENG365_MYSQL_DATABASE={a database starting with your usercode then an underscore}
```

For example:

```
SENG365_MYSQL_HOST=db2.csse.canterbury.ac.nz
SENG365_MYSQL_USER=abc123
SENG365_MYSQL_PASSWORD=password
SENG365_MYSQL_DATABASE=abc123_s365
```

## Some notes about endpoint status codes

The api spec provides several status codes that each endpoint can return. Apart from the 500 'Internal Server Error'
each of these represents a flow that may be tested. Hopefully from the labs you have seen these status codes before and
have an understanding of what each represents. A brief overview is provided in the table below.

| Status Code | Status Message        | Description                                                                   | Example                                          |
